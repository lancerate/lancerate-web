# Lancerate
A crowdsourced verification system for freelancers to know the ideal amount they should charge for their services. Thousands of freelancers of the same field review and rate each other's portfolios which helps a freelancer to be certain of the hourly rate of his/her services. The reviewers in turn get ranked on a leaderboard wherein the person with the max reputation at the end of the week gets rewards such as Amazon vouchers and/or Paytm credits etc.

## Features
- Select your categories of interest and post your portfolio(s) to get reviewed
- Rate and comment on others' portfolios<br/>
Insensitive comments get filtered out automatically by our constructive criticism algorithm.
- Real-time updates on your profile to estimate your rate accurately
- View the weekly leaderboard which ranks users by the "reputation" they earned over the week
- Use our [voluntary badge embed](https://lancerate.herokuapp.com/users/anshulsaha) on Upwork, Fiverr etc. as a validation method for your rate to your clients
